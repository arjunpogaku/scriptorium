A self-hosted, multi-user web IDE for writing LaTeX: a project/file
manager, a real-time collaborative code editor with LaTeX syntax
highlighting and autocomplete, a live PDF preview, comments and chat, and
full version history — all running on hardware you own. No per-seat
subscription, no vendor lock-in. Everything — the app and every project —
lives on your own server.

## What this is (and isn't)

This is a **self-hosted team LaTeX editor**, built for a lab or research
group to run on a machine they control (their own server, a lab box, a
small VPS) instead of renting an Overleaf subscription per collaborator.
It has accounts, invite-only signup, an admin panel, roles (editor/viewer),
share links, and real-time collaborative editing (Yjs CRDT) with
attribution, comments, and chat — the collaboration features Overleaf
paywalls are just built in here.

It is **not** a public multi-tenant SaaS — there's no database, no
per-tenant isolation beyond per-user file ownership, and it's sized for
"tens of users on hardware a lab already owns," not thousands of strangers
signing up over the open internet. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for
running it as a shared server for your team, with TLS in front of it, and
[USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) for a complete walkthrough of every feature
once it's running.

## Features

- **Accounts & access control** — email/password accounts with TOTP 2FA,
  invite-only signup by default (`QUIRELOOP_OPEN_SIGNUP=true` to open it
  up), an admin panel (list/deactivate users, revoke sessions, manage
  invites), per-IP and per-account login rate limiting, and 30-day
  sessions with a `secure`-flag cookie option for TLS deployments.
- **Real-time collaboration** — multiple people editing the same file at
  once (Yjs CRDT), with each collaborator's cursor and attribution visible
  live, backed by server-side persistence so edits survive a restart.
- **Roles & sharing** — collaborators are `editor` or `viewer` per project;
  revocable, tokenized share links carry a role with them.
- **Comments & chat** — comments anchored to text ranges (survive
  concurrent edits), threaded and resolvable; a project chat sidebar
  alongside the editor.
- **Projects & files** — multiple projects, nested folders, image/`.bib`
  uploads, drag-and-drop, rename/delete.
- **Templates** — start a new project from Blank, Article, Report, Beamer,
  or CV/Resume.
- **Editor** — CodeMirror 6 with LaTeX syntax highlighting, autocomplete,
  code folding, find & replace, a symbol/snippet insert palette, spell
  check, optional Vim keybindings, dark mode, and autosave.
- **Project-wide search** — grep across every file in a project, with a
  jump-to-match panel.
- **Compile** — LaTeX → PDF via `latexmk` (pdfLaTeX / XeLaTeX / LuaLaTeX,
  switchable per project), with parsed compile errors shown as editor
  gutter markers and a structured error list — not a wall of raw log text
  — plus optional auto-compile on idle.
- **PDF preview** — zoom, fit-width, page jump, and two-way **SyncTeX**
  (click in the PDF to jump to source, and vice versa).
- **Version history** — automatic snapshots on every successful compile,
  plus manual named snapshots, one-click restore, and a side-by-side diff
  view between any two snapshots.
- **Import from Overleaf** — paste an Overleaf project's git URL (and a git
  token, if it's private) to clone it in as a new local project. One-time
  import, not a live sync — after that it's just a regular local project.
- **Upload a project** — pick a `.zip` (e.g. Overleaf's own "Download .zip",
  or any folder of `.tex`/`.bib`/image files you zip up yourself) to bring
  it in as a new project. Handles zips that wrap everything in one folder.
- **Source Control** — every project is its own real git repository from the
  moment you create it (not a Quireloop-specific format). A VS Code–style
  panel in the editor shows changed files, lets you write a commit message
  and commit, and push/pull to a remote you set per project — a GitHub repo,
  a GitLab repo, or back to Overleaf's own git bridge. Nothing is pushed
  automatically; you're always in control of when.
- **Download** — grab the compiled PDF or the whole project as a `.zip`.
- **Outline panel** — jump between `\section`/`\chapter` headings; live
  word count.
- **Dark mode** — toggle on the dashboard or in the editor; defaults to your
  system's light/dark setting on first visit.

## Two editions, one codebase

| | **Solo Edition** | **Server Edition** |
|---|---|---|
| For | One researcher, on their own machine | A lab or team, on a shared server |
| Install | Clone + `npm install` + run (below) | Docker or bare metal behind TLS — see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) |
| Accounts | Just yours (first signup = admin) | Invite-only signup, roles, admin panel |
| Collaboration | Everything still works if you later invite someone on your LAN | Real-time editing, comments, chat, track changes over the network |
| Where papers live | `data/` on your machine | `data/` on the server (the one thing to back up) |

There is no feature switch — the Solo Edition **is** the full app running
locally for one person. If your lab later wants in, the same install
becomes a Server Edition by putting it on a shared machine per
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md); your `data/` directory moves with it.

## Prerequisites (both editions)

- **Node.js 20+**
- **A LaTeX distribution** with `latexmk` and `synctex` on your `PATH` —
  e.g. [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/)
  on macOS, TeX Live on Linux, or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) on Windows.
  Nothing LaTeX-related is bundled — this app shells out to your existing
  install. Verify it's on your PATH:

  ```
  latexmk --version
  synctex version
  ```

- **`git` and `unzip`** on your `PATH` — `git` backs every project's version
  control (Source Control panel, Import from Overleaf); `unzip` backs
  "Upload Project (.zip)". Both ship by default on macOS and most Linux
  distros.

## Solo Edition — install and run

```
git clone https://github.com/arjunpogaku/quireloop.git
cd quireloop
npm install
npm run build --workspace=web
cd server && npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:4173**, sign up (your account is the admin), and
write. That's the whole install.

**Always-on (recommended for day-to-day solo writing), macOS only:**

The friction of "open a terminal and start the server" before you can even
begin writing is real — this makes Quireloop behave like an installed app
instead of a dev project you have to boot up:

```
npm install
npm run build --workspace=web
npm run service:install
```

This installs a [LaunchAgent](https://www.launchd.info/) that starts
Quireloop at login and keeps it running in the background — restarting it
automatically if it ever crashes. From then on, opening
**http://localhost:4173** (bookmark it) just works, every time, with
nothing to remember to start first. Logs land in
`~/Library/Logs/Quireloop/`. To stop it running at login:
`npm run service:uninstall`.

On Linux, the equivalent is a `systemd --user` unit running
`node server/src/index.js` with `WantedBy=default.target`; there's no
installer script for that here yet.

The port can be changed with the `PORT` environment variable, e.g.
`PORT=8080 npm start`. To reach it from another device on your network,
use `http://<this-machine's-LAN-IP>:4173` — the server binds to all
interfaces.

**Server Edition:** same code, run on a shared machine with TLS in front —
Docker, nginx, and systemd walkthroughs are in
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

**Development mode (auto-reload while hacking on the app itself):**

```
cd server && npm start        # terminal 1 — API on :4173
cd web && npm run dev         # terminal 2 — UI on :5173 with hot reload
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in dev mode; API calls are proxied to the
server in `web/vite.config.js`.

First visit prompts you to create an account — **the first account created
becomes the admin** (see the [security note](#security-note) below).
From there you'll land on an empty dashboard — create a project, import
one from Overleaf, or upload a `.zip` to get started. Invite the rest of
your lab from the admin panel; see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) if
you're setting this up as a shared server rather than just for yourself.

## Where your data lives — and why it's kept separate from this repo

There are deliberately **two completely separate git histories** at play,
and they never mix:

1. **This repo** (Quireloop's own source code) — what you cloned. It has
   no knowledge of any paper you write with it.
2. **Each project's own repo**, created automatically the moment you make a
   project, living at `data/projects/<id>/`. That folder is *entirely*
   `.gitignore`d by this repo (see the root `.gitignore` — just one line,
   `data/`), so nothing you write ever becomes part of Quireloop's commit
   history, and a `git status` in this repo never shows your papers.

Each project folder holds plain files — a `manifest.json` (Quireloop's own
bookkeeping) plus your real `.tex`/`.bib`/image files exactly as you'd have
them locally — with its own `.git` underneath, its own commit history, and
optionally its own remote (configured per project in the **Source Control**
panel). Quireloop's bookkeeping (`manifest.json`, `build/`, `versions/`,
and the file that stores your remote's access token) is excluded from that
inner repo too, via a `.gitignore` Quireloop writes into every project —
so if you push a project to GitHub or back to Overleaf, only your actual
paper goes with it, never Quireloop's internals or your token.

`data/` also holds the plain-JSON account/session state (`users.json`,
`invites.json`, the session-signing key) alongside `data/projects/`. There
is no database anywhere. Back up `data/` however you like — Time Machine,
syncing it to another drive, or (for the project files specifically)
pushing each project to its own remote. Deleting this repo's folder
deletes everything in it, `data/` included, so keep that backup separate
from your clone of this repo.

## Project structure

```
server/   Fastify API — accounts, project/file management, real-time
          collaboration, latexmk compile, SyncTeX
web/      React + CodeMirror 6 frontend (Vite)
data/     Accounts + your projects (git-ignored — created on first run)
```

## Deploy it for your lab

Running it locally for yourself (above) needs nothing beyond `npm start`.
Running it as a shared server for a team — Docker image with TeX Live
baked in, an nginx reference config for TLS and the WebSocket collab
endpoint, a systemd unit for bare-metal installs, backup/upgrade
procedure, and every `QUIRELOOP_*` environment variable — is covered in
**[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

## Security note

The first account created on a fresh deployment becomes the admin; every
signup after that requires an admin-issued invite by default (see
`QUIRELOOP_OPEN_SIGNUP` in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) to change that).
Even so, this is built for a trusted lab/team, not a public-internet
signup flow — there's no email verification, no per-tenant billing/quota
isolation, and it's sized for tens of users, not a stranger-facing SaaS.
If you're exposing it beyond `localhost` or a network you trust, put TLS
in front of it (the nginx reference config in `deploy/` covers this) so
credentials and project content aren't sent in the clear.
